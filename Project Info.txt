Workout App (name tbd)

I would like to create a web-based application to host and track workout progress for multiple users.

We would need to create accounts for our users to sync their workouts with. An account would need an email address, name, birthday (to use to get their age for calculations), height and current weight. 

Users can then create a workout plan consistening of workout routines. Each workout routine can be assigned to days of the week on their workout calendar. 

Each workout routine will consist of multiple exercises. Each exercise has a different number of sets and suggested rep ranges assosicated with them. 

We can have pre-defined exercises that the user can choose from. If an exercise is not listed, they can create a custom exercise. 
When selecting an exercise, a user should be able to choose what they want to use the exercise for (strength, hypertrophy or endurance) and it'll suggest rep ranges to train in. If the user does not like the suggested ones, they can change them.


It would be nice for each exercise to be able to list what muscles it targets as well as what equipment is used (body weight, barbell, dumb bell, cable machine, t-bar, etc) 
as well as the type of exercise it is focusing on (hypertrophy, strength, endurance) based on the rep range being trained.

Exercises would need images attached to them to help the user know how the exercise mechanics work.
